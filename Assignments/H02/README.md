## Assignment 06: Hasing - Strategies and Collision Resolution


## Part A: Conceptual Questions

1. **Define Hasing and Collision Resoltion**
   
    - **What is a hash table and why is collision resolution necessary?** A hash table is a data structure that allows efficient storage and retrival of key-value pairs using a hash function to map keys to indices in an array. This mapping allows for average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups.
  


    - **Explain the key differences between open hashing (chaining) and closed hashing (open addressing).**
